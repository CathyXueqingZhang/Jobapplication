I have two year study experience in computer science in University of Dayton. I have done so many diifferent projects. I list some special program I have done before.

Program 1: Calculator
- I implemented a core part of a calculator that for a given sequence of computation (e.g. “5 + 3 * 12 / 25”), my program is able to analyze the expression string by extracting out numbers or operators, and finally compute the result if the input is a valid expression.
