I have finished 5 computer science courses in University of Dayton, including 1 advanced graduate level course(CPS 501 Advanced Programming and Data Structures). I finished so many different projects during my study. I list some special program I have done before.

### Program 1: Calculator
- For this Project, I implemented a core part of a calculator that for a given sequence of computation (e.g. “5 + 3 * 12 / 25”), my program is able to analyze the expression string by extracting out numbers or operators, and finally compute the result if the input is a valid expression.<br/>


### Program 2: Binary Search Tree
- For this project, I will create Binary Search Tree (BST) and implement the action of insert/delete a node. <br/>


### Program 3: Local Messenger
- For this project, I use FXML to develop a local messenger system simulating an online chatting application, such as Skype. Two windows are created locally to mimic a remote conversation scenario.<br/>


### Program 4: Information Saving
- Fot this project, I will connect Java with MySQL to store the information.<br/>
