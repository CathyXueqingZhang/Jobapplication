I have finished 5 computer science courses in University of Dayton, including 1 advanced graduate level course(CPS 501 Advanced Programming and Data Structures). I finished so many different projects during my study. I list some special program I have done before.

### Program 1: Calculator
- For this Project, I implemented a core part of a calculator that for a given sequence of computation (e.g. “5 + 3 * 12 / 25”), my program is able to analyze the expression string by extracting out numbers or operators, and finally compute the result if the input is a valid expression.<br/>
