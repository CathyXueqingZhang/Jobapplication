For this project, I will implement a core part of a calculator that for a given sequence of computation (e.g. “5 + 3 * 12 / 25”), my program is able to analyze the expression string by extracting out numbers or operators, and finally compute the result if the input is a valid expression. To achieve this goal, I will use the “Stack” class to store those data and process them properly. The detailed instructions are given as below.
