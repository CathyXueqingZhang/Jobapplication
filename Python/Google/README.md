# Google Play Store
Android is the dominant mobile operating system today with about 85% of all mobile devices running Google’s OS. The Google Play Store is the largest and most popular Android app store.<br/><br/>
The purpose of this project was to gather and analyze detailed information on apps in the Google Play Store in order to provide insights on app features and the current state of the Android app market.<br/><br/>
This two datasets Datasets (from Kaggle) includes descriptive information on over 10800 apps across 33 different categories in the Google App Store, such as Business, Food & Drink, Books & Reference, Travel & Local, Health & Fitness, News & Magazines, Education, Social, Finance, Medical, and Entertainment.<br/><br/>

<br/> It looks like certain app categories have more free apps available for download than others. In our dataset, the majority of apps in Food & Drink, News and Magazines, as well as Social categories were free to install. At the same time, Health & Fitness, Travel & Local, Education, and Medical categories had the biggest number of paid apps available for download.<br/>

## NLP Analysis
Since the Google play store dataset also company with the review comments data, we also did some NLP analysis on it.<br/>

<br/>When I got the data, the first question is how is the data look like? So you can see from those charts that people’s review were classified into three category ,the positive, neutral and negative,  and here is their distribution. I also draw a scatter plot to see where the actual sentiment points are. You could see that the points in the positive side have more density and they are quite around the neutral mid line.
