I had applied expertise in analyzing and managing large-scale database applications and generated strategic reports and data analytic models, such as multiple regression models, cluster models, and t-SNE models, by using Python. I also understand how to do machine learning by using machine (such as using numpy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, seaborn).
