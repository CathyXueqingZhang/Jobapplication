### Conclusion
- Chicago is a good place to find a job. Based on my analyze, the occupations belong to Business, Science & Arts could be the
first good choice in Chicago. After that, you can consider the occupations belong to Service.
- Although occupations are different, many policies to promote equal pay and alleviate within-job “discrimination,” especially
the preferential treatment favoring the locals (rather than to provide equal access to different jobs) are crucial for migrants’
labor outcome. Finding favorite job and working hard will make you successful.
